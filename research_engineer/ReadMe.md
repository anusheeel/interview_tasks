There are two python scripts. 
1) api.py: This script is an Rest API designed using flask which displays the required dictionary.
On a local server the endpoint can be reached via http://127.0.0.1:5000/grid-power-analysis/
2) test_sim.py: A pandapower simulation script which simulates the netowrk and returns the required dictionary.

There is one html script in /template folder
3) results.html: This html script is used to render the dictionary on the webpage when the api makes a call.

Lastly,
I have also attached my authored paper named Final Manuscript (Clean). pdf which is a complete report of a research done on the energy trading technology.
